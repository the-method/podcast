00:00 I think the number one issue in science today is what's being called  

the reproducibility crisis.

00:06 The fact that many biological studies can't be reproduced by other labs with similar tools.

00:15 I think the most exciting innovation in science today is a growing application of 3D printing inside of a lab.  

00:21 Now anyone can open a browser, go to the 3D print exchange and download anything from molecular and anatomical models for teaching to custom lab hardware, like microscope pieces to apply directly to research.  

00:34 Beyond that we're now seeing direct applications of 3D printing to biology and medicine like the printing of implantable tissues scaffolds.  

00:43 So that's definitely a field that'll be following closely.
